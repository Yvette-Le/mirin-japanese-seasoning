                    <h3>What is Mirin?</h3>
                    <p>Mirin is a sweet cooking wine that can be found in many Japanese dishes. It is a traditional
                        seasoning that many people in western cultures are unaware of.
                        Mirin is slightly thick with an opaque, golden color, and can be used for glazing or to season a
                        dish
                        by adding a slight sweetness to it. Mirin can also help reduce the fishy smell of seafood, and
                        many
                        believe that
                        using it will help with better absorption of flavours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> People may be confused about the difference
                        between sake and mirin. Sake has higher alcohol and lower sugar content whereas mirin has a
                        lower
                        alcohol and higher sugar content. The alcohol content of mirin can range from 8% to 14%. Mirin
                        is
                        also not to be confused with rice vinegar.

                    <h3>How is Mirin Made?</h3>
                    <p>The Japanese seasoning is made by combining glutinous rice and shochu, a type of alcohol similar
                        to
                        vodka. The rice is then fermented for a few months. By fermenting the rice, a bacterial culture
                        called Koji is created and is often used in cooking. Koji breaks down enzymes and proteins in
                        the
                        grains of rice resulting in left over amino acids and complex sugars that we now know as mirin.
                        Mirin can sometimes be made with sake (which is made of mostly rice) instead of shochu (which
                        can be
                        made of ingredients such as sweet potato, barley, corn, etc.).</p>

                    <h3>Types of Mirin</h3>
                    <p>Mirin can be roughly categorized into two types: hon-mirin and aji-mirin. Hon-mirin is a Japanese
                        term that translates to ‘true mirin’ and is considered as the most authentic and pure form of
                        mirin.
                        It contains no added sugar or salt and a higher amount of alcohol content. It is more expensive
                        than
                        aji-mirin and is usually harder to buy at the market. Aji-mirin roughly translates to
                        ‘mirin-like
                        taste’ and is a condiment made to taste like true mirin. It has a lower amount of alcohol
                        content
                        (sometimes none at all) and contains added ingredients such as corn syrup, sugar, and salt. It
                        is
                        highly recommended that you use hon-mirin instead of aji-mirin if you can obtain it from your
                        local
                        grocery store. </p>

                    <h3>Cooking with Mirin</h3>
                    <p>Many Japanese dishes uses mirin as a seasoning because it adds a deeper depth of flavor and
                        luster to
                        the food (think teriyaki sauce). It also helps with tenderizing ingredients. If you decide to
                        cook
                        with mirin, keep in mind to store it in a cool place. It will keep well for up to 3 months. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some individuals may find it difficult to buy mirin based on where they live, or some may try to
                        exempt this ingredient from their recipes due to their circumstances of not being to have
                        alcohol.
                        Fear not: you can make a substitution to replace the real thing. Although the taste may not be
                        exactly the same, it is better to add your own version of the seasoning instead of completely
                        omitting it. If you can have alcohol in your cooking, mix sake and sugar together at a 3:1 ratio
                        respectively. If you cannot have alcohol, you can use water and sugar at a 3:1 ratio. </p>
