                    <h2>What is Mirin?</h2>
                    <p>Mirin is a sweet cooking wine that can be found in many Japanese dishes. It is a traditional
                        seasoning that many people in western cultures are unaware of.
                        Mirin is slightly thick with an opaque, golden color, and can be used for glazing or to season a
                        dish
                        by adding a slight sweetness to it. The seasoning can also help reduce the fishy smell of
                        seafood, and many believe that using it will help with better absorption of flavours. Having a
                        bottle at home will truly elevate your cooking experience!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Many people may be confused about the difference
                        between sake and mirin. Sake has higher alcohol and lower sugar content. It is usually added
                        earlier in the cooking process to evaporate the alcohol.
                        Mirin has a lower
                        alcohol and higher sugar content. The alcohol content can range from 0% to 14% and it is not to
                        be confused with rice vinegar which is significantly more acidic.

                    <h2>How is Mirin Seasoning Made?</h2>
                    <p>The Japanese seasoning is made by combining glutinous rice and shochu, a type of alcohol similar
                        to
                        vodka. The rice is then fermented for a few months. By fermenting the rice, a bacterial culture
                        called Koji is created and is often used in cooking. Koji breaks down enzymes and proteins in
                        the
                        grains of rice resulting in left over amino acids and complex sugars that we now know as mirin.
                        The Japanese seasoning can sometimes be made with sake (which is made of mostly rice) instead of
                        shochu (which
                        can be made of ingredients such as sweet potato, barley, corn, pumpkin, etc.).</p>

                <h2>Types of Japanese Mirin</h2>
                <p>Mirin Japanese seasoning can be roughly categorized into two types: hon-mirin and aji-mirin.
                    Hon-mirin is a Japanese
                    term that translates to ‘true mirin’ and is considered as the most authentic and pure form.
                    It contains no added sugar or salt and a higher amount of alcohol content. It is more expensive
                    than and is usually harder to buy at the market. Aji-mirin roughly translates to
                    ‘mirin-like
                    taste’ and is a condiment made to taste like the pure form. It has a lower amount of alcohol
                    content
                    (sometimes none at all) and contains added ingredients such as corn syrup, sugar, and salt. It
                    is
                    highly recommended that you use hon-mirin instead of aji-mirin if you can obtain it from your
                    local grocery store. </p>
            </div>

                <div id="storing">
                    <h2>Buying and Storing Mirin</h2>
                    <p>The ingredient can be bought at your local Asian grocery store that carries Japanese products. To
                        name
                        a few in Edmonton, T&T, Lucky 97, and H-Mart are some markets that you can go to. If you
                        do not have an Asian grocery store nearby, some lucky individuals may be able to find it in the
                        Asian section of grocery stores such as Save-on-Foods, Superstore, or Sobeys. You may be also
                        able to purchase
                        the Japanese seasoning
                        online on websites such as Amazon, Natura Market, and Umami Shop.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you decide to cook with it, keep in mind to store it in a cool place. It will keep well for
                        up to 3 months. </p>

                    <h2>Cooking with Mirin Japanese Seasoning</h2>
                    <p>Many Japanese dishes uses the seasoning because it adds a deeper depth of flavor and
                        luster to the food (think teriyaki sauce). It also helps with tenderizing ingredients and is
                        great for salad dressings and stir-fried or braised dishes (believe it or not, there are even
                        some Korean dishes
                        that incorporate this condiment).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some of you may say that you cannot get the ingredient because of where you live or you cannot
                        have
                        alcohol due to dietary restrictions.
                        Fear not: you can make a substitution to replace the real thing. Although the taste may not be
                        exactly the same, it is better to add your own version of the ingredient instead of completely
                        omitting it. If you can have alcohol in your cooking, mix sake and sugar together at a 3:1 ratio
                        respectively. If you cannot have alcohol, use water and sugar at a 3:1 ratio. Bon Appetit also
                        suggests using dry sherry or sweet marsala wine with some sugar if you
                        are really in a crunch. </p>

                    <h3>Basics of a Japanese Kitchen</h3>
                    <p>Recently GaijinPot, a popular hub for many expats living in Japan, has written a great article on
                        the basic necessities of a Japanese kitchen. Every country has common ingredients used in their
                        cooking and Japan is no exception. These ingredients include soy sauce, mirin, cooking sake, and
                        sugar. What makes these seasonings unique is the perfectly melded flavours between sweet and
                        savoury. Soy sauce provides saltiness. Mirin and sugar balances out the saltiness while
                        repelling any unpleasant odors that may come from meat or fish. As GaijinPot states, “if you
                        have these four things, they open up an entire world of Japanese cooking” and we agree!</p>
                    <p>With these four ingredients, you can make anything from glazes, soups, and stir-fries. GaijinPot
                        recommends using mirin for dishes such as for gyudon (beef rice bowl), beef udon (noodle soup),
                        and yakisoba (stir-fried noodles with any toppings you wish to add). They also explain different
                        methods of cooking that includes simmering, steaming, and deep-frying. </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Speaking of cooking, did you know that there are various cuts you can use when preparing
                                ingredients? The ‘rangiri’ cut roughly translates to random cut, and is good for braised
                                dishes.
                                The ‘hangetsu giri’ is a half-moon cut that can be used to cook vegetables quickly and
                                evenly in
                                soups. The ‘sogigiri’ is a diagonal cut that is used to get even slices of thickness for
                                mushrooms, napa cabbage, and sometimes meat. Very interesting if you would like to know
                                more
                                about Japanese cuisine!</p>
                            <p>If you’re looking to purchase some kitchen appliances, a rice cooker are a must-have for
                                Japanese
                                cooking! While a rice cooker obviously cooks rice, you can also create other things such
                                as
                                congee, stews, and bread. Another appliance we recommend purchasing is a bamboo steamer.
                                This is
                                cost efficient way to enhance your kitchen aesthetic while looking like a pro cook! </p>

                        <h3>Mirin-Soy Sauce</h3>
                        <p>One recipe that you can easily make is ‘Mirin-Soy Sauce.’ If you’ve ever had an Unagi-don
                            (eel
                            Japanese rice bowl), then you may be familiar with the sweet and savory sauce that takes the
                            dish to a whole other level. The best part about this sauce is that you only need three
                            ingredients! </p>
                        <p>Start off with half a cup of soy sauce, half a cup of mirin, and a quarter cup of sugar. Add
                            all
                            ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Stirring occasionally,
                            reduce the mixture until there is about three-fourths of a cup left. Then, take it off the
                            heat
                            and let it cool for 15 minutes. And there you have it! This sauce can be stored in the
                            fridge
                            for up to 2 weeks and can be served with rice or noodles. </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Misoyaki Sauce</h3>
                        <p>The term ‘misoyaki’ literally translates to miso-grilled in Japanese. This sauce is quite
                            popular, and many high-end Japanese restaurants have some sort of version of it. It is
                            usually served with lighter grilled fishes such as halibut, cod, or tuna. That being said,
                            this sauce is great as a dip, a salad dressing, or as a marinade. Best of all it only takes
                            15 minutes to make!</p>
                        <p>Start off with 3 tablespoons of mirin, a quarter cup of sake, half a cup of white miso, and a
                            quarter cup of sugar. Combine the mirin and sake in a saucepan and heat for a couple of
                            minutes. Then, add the rest of the ingredients and stir to dissolve the sugar. Once slightly
                            thickened, turn off the heat and cool the sauce completely. This sauce can be stored for up
                            to 2 weeks in the fridge. </p>
