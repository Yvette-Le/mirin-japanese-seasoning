                    <h3>What is Mirin?</h3>
                    <p>Mirin is a sweet cooking wine that can be found in many Japanese dishes. It is a traditional
                        seasoning that many people in western cultures are unaware of.
                        Mirin is slightly thick with an opaque, golden color, and can be used for glazing or to season a
                        dish
                        by adding a slight sweetness to it. The seasoning can also help reduce the fishy smell of
                        seafood, and
                        many believe that
                        using it will help with better absorption of flavours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> People may be confused about the difference
                        between sake and mirin. Sake has higher alcohol and lower sugar content whereas mirin has a
                        lower
                        alcohol and higher sugar content. The alcohol content can range from 0% to 14% and is not to be
                        confused with rice vinegar.

                    <h3>How is Mirin Seasoning Made?</h3>
                    <p>The Japanese seasoning is made by combining glutinous rice and shochu, a type of alcohol similar
                        to
                        vodka. The rice is then fermented for a few months. By fermenting the rice, a bacterial culture
                        called Koji is created and is often used in cooking. Koji breaks down enzymes and proteins in
                        the
                        grains of rice resulting in left over amino acids and complex sugars that we now know as mirin.
                        The Japanese seasoning can sometimes be made with sake (which is made of mostly rice) instead of
                        shochu (which
                        can be made of ingredients such as sweet potato, barley, corn, etc.).</p>

                <h3>Types of Japanese Mirin</h3>
                <p>Mirin Japanese seasoning can be roughly categorized into two types: hon-mirin and aji-mirin.
                    Hon-mirin is a Japanese
                    term that translates to ‘true mirin’ and is considered as the most authentic and pure form.
                    It contains no added sugar or salt and a higher amount of alcohol content. It is more expensive
                    than and is usually harder to buy at the market. Aji-mirin roughly translates to
                    ‘mirin-like
                    taste’ and is a condiment made to taste like the pure form. It has a lower amount of alcohol
                    content
                    (sometimes none at all) and contains added ingredients such as corn syrup, sugar, and salt. It
                    is
                    highly recommended that you use hon-mirin instead of aji-mirin if you can obtain it from your
                    local grocery store. </p>

                    <h3>Buying and Storing Mirin</h3>
                    <p>The ingredient can be bought at your local Asian grocery store that carries Japanese products. To
                        name
                        a few in Edmonton, T&T, Lucky 97, and H-Mart are some markets that you can go to. If you
                        do not have an Asian grocery store nearby, some lucky individuals may be able to find it in the
                        Asian section of grocery stores such as Save-on-Foods or Superstore. You may be also able to purchase
                        the Japanese seasoning
                        online.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you decide to cook with it, keep in mind to store it in a cool place. It will keep well for
                        up to 3 months. </p>

                    <h3>Cooking with Mirin Japanese Seasoning</h3>
                    <p>Many Japanese dishes uses the seasoning because it adds a deeper depth of flavor and
                        luster to the food (think teriyaki sauce). It also helps with tenderizing ingredients and is
                        great for stir-fried or braised dishes. There are
                        some great resources out there
                        if you wish to find out more about the Japanese seasoning such as
                        <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-mirin-how-to-substitute">Bon Appetit</a> and
                        <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/mirin/">Just One Cookbook</a>.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Some of you may say that you cannot get the ingredient because of where you live or you cannot
                        have
                        alcohol due to dietary restrictions.
                        Fear not: you can make a substitution to replace the real thing. Although the taste may not be
                        exactly the same, it is better to add your own version of the ingredient instead of completely
                        omitting it. If you can have alcohol in your cooking, mix sake and sugar together at a 3:1 ratio
                        respectively. If you cannot have alcohol, you can use water and sugar at a 3:1 ratio. </p>
